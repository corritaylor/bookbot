# 📚 Bookbot

Welcome to **Bookbot**!  
This project is part of my learning journey through **Boot.dev**, and it’s one of my very first Python projects—pretty exciting stuff! 🚀

---

## 🛠️ About the Project

**Bookbot** is a simple Python program that reads novels and analyzes them.  
It generates a statistical report showing:

- Word usage
- Character usage

It’s a fun and practical way to get familiar with Python basics while working on a real project.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By building Bookbot, I’m practicing how to:

- Set up a **professional Python development environment**  
- Build a **full project from scratch**  
- **Deploy** a Python project to my **personal GitHub account**  
- Use a **professional code editor** (like **VS Code**) efficiently

## 🚀 How to Run Bookbot

If you want to try it out:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  
2. Clone this repository or download the code.
3. Open the project in your favorite code editor (I’m using VS Code!).
4. Run the script:

```bash
python bookbot.py
```

Follow the prompts, and watch the magic happen! 📖✨

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Building Bookbot isn’t just about analyzing books—it's about getting hands-on experience with:

- Setting up real-world projects
- Managing code on GitHub
- Learning good coding habits early on

Every big coding journey starts with a first project... and this is mine!
